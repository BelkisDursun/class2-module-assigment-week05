# Question 1
Write a program which randomly picks an integer from 1 to 100. Your program should
prompt the user for guesses – if the user guesses incorrectly, it should print whether the
guess is too high or too low. If the user guesses correctly, the program should print how
much time the user spend to guess the right answer. You can assume that the user will enter
valid input.

# Question 2
In this program, you'll learn to find the least common multiple (L.C.M.) of two numbers and
display it.(use gcd function in module of math )

# Question 2 extra
In this program, you'll learn to find the least common multiple (L.C.M.) of four numbers and
display it.(use gcd function in module of math )

# Question 5
battleships.py
As per our request, you are to develop an “ battleships ” game that is
intended to be played between user and computer itself. Also, with the
algorithm you create, you’re expected to make the computer play the game
with reasonable moves rather than random moves. The most important of
all, we want you to create a program that is built by dividing the game into
pieces and building modules and importing the modules.(we want 5*5 table and 2 ship ,
one of them 3 dots ship and the other 2 dots ship, the ship destroyed in one hit)

# Question 6
Write a calculator program using try except blocks.
